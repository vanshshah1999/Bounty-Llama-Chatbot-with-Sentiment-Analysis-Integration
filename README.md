# Customer Support Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on creating a sentiment-aware **Customer Support Chatbot** using the Llama 2 model and a sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face. The chatbot is designed to assist customers by dynamically adjusting its responses based on their emotional state. If the sentiment of the customer's query is detected as **negative** (e.g., frustration or dissatisfaction), the bot provides a more empathetic and apologetic response, offering additional support. Conversely, for **positive** sentiments, it reinforces satisfaction and offers further suggestions or services. The bot aims to improve user experience by tailoring interactions to each user's mood, enhancing both customer satisfaction and service efficiency.
